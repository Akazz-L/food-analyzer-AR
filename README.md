Food Analyzer AR 
===========================
This project combines AI and AR to provide a playful mobile app that analyzes the food's composition in order
to help consumers to make the best food choices for their health. Using those two promising technologies together provides an unique experience when it comes health care. Whenever you hesitate to eat some food, take out your phone and take a picture of the food ! Within a few milliseconds the app will display the nutrition facts of your captured food.

This project uses Google ARCore to enable AR-display on food nutrition facts and TensorFlowSharp package which is a C#-based version of TensorFlow that can be used in Unity to embed trained models on mobile devices. The main project folder is in Assets/FoodAnalyzerAR.


## Google ARCore

See the [Getting Started with Google ARCore](//developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/getting-started) developer guide.


## TensorflowSharp

See the [TensorflowSharp documentation](//https://github.com/llSourcell/Unity_ML_Agents/blob/master/docs/Using-TensorFlow-Sharp-in-Unity-(Experimental).md).

## Install
As the TensorFlowSharp package is large, you must manually download it and import it in Unity.
Run the *get_packages.sh* script to automatically download and move the TensorflowSharp package in the main repo Packages folder

NB : Please follow the TensorFlowSharp documentation to configure Unity.
